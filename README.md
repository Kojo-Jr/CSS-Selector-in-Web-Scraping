# CSS-Selector-in-Web-Scraping
As Data Scientists, we often encounter situations where a pre-prepared database isn't available for analysis. In many cases, data isn't directly accessible through databases or APIs, and we must use alternative methods to gather the needed information. One such method is web scraping; the process of extracting data from websites across the internet.

Web scraping provides a powerful way to access publicly available data, enabling us to collect, clean, and process information that might otherwise be out of reach. This repository explores the techniques and tools required for web scraping, allowing Data Scientists to harness valuable data from the web for their projects and research.
